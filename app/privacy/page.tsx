          <p>
            When we refer to &quot;this Statement&quot;, &quot;this Privacy Statement&quot; and &quot;our Statement&quot;, we mean the Privacy Statement you are reading now. Wherever we say &quot;FreeStockAlerts.AI&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;, we mean Wealthpire Inc. d/b/a FreeStockAlerts.AI. We use the words &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; to mean you, the reader, and other visitors to our online and mobile resources who are, in all cases, over the age of 13, or otherwise have verifiable parental consent to view this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about our &quot;online and mobile resources&quot;, we mean all websites, applications, portals or other features we operate to allow you to interact with us and our systems, as well as any mobile apps we&apos;ve created and distributed to let you interact with the content we provide. An &quot;affinity action&quot; is when you &quot;follow&quot; us, &quot;like&quot; us or take a similar or analogous action on our external social media presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we refer to &quot;personal information&quot;, we mean any information, data or data element, whether in electronic or other form, that, alone or in combination with other elements, can be used to distinguish, trace, or discover your identity. Where applicable data privacy laws include specific elements or defined terms for what they consider to be personal information (sometimes also referred to as &quot;personal data&quot;), then the term &quot;personal data&quot; includes the specific elements and defined terms required by such laws.

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">How Do We Collect Your Personal Information?</h2>

          </ul>
          <p>
            If you prefer that we not receive the above-described personal information, please don&apos;t submit it. Your use of our online and mobile resources is strictly your choice. By not participating, you may limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile resources, but most of the content will still be available to you and we never discriminate on the basis of how much information you provide.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Automatic Collection</h3>
          <p>
            When you visit or use our online and mobile resources, information about your internet/electronic activity is automatically collected through your browser via tracking technologies, such as &quot;cookies.&quot; Cookies are small text files downloaded onto your computer or mobile device. Cookies allow us to collect your IP address and recognize your computer or mobile device and store some information about your preferences for using our online and mobile resources or past actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you access our online and mobile resources from a phone or other mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit to us certain information such as uniquely identifiable mobile device information.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-6 mb-3">External Sources</h3>
          <p>
            We may work with companies who provide us with data, including personal information, so that we can tailor our services to audiences who have the most interest. We also may work with digital advertising and marketing companies to provide you with ads that meet your interests. These ads may be displayed on websites or device applications operated by third parties. These third parties collect information with their own cookies, pixels, and related tracking technology and then provide that information to us. We are not responsible for their data collection practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            We maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms. We are not responsible for either the content on, or the privacy practices of, social media platforms, or any third-party sites or apps to which we link. Those apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by us and therefore have their own privacy policies and terms of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain coalitions of advertisers allow consumers to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising. You can visit the <a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" className="text-primary underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" className="text-primary underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative</a> to opt out.
